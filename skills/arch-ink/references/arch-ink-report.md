- **Rules loaded**: [structure-rules / structure-rules + arc-rules]
- **Genre / comparisons**: [if provided — or "not provided"]

### First Impression
[2-3 sentences. Gut read on structural soundness. Not a summary — the instinct.]

|---------|-------|----------|-----|-----------|
| [name] | N | beat A, beat B, beat C | MAJ | [systemic direction ≤15 words, in French] |

### Strengths

| Beat | Axis | Mechanism | Effect |
|------|------|-----------|--------|
| [identified beat] | [axis] | [what the author did] | [why it works] |

> Never empty unless genuinely nothing works — in which case state that explicitly.

### Global verdict

[1-2 sentences. The structural truth.]

### Priority fixes

1. BLK #[N] — [highest-impact action, in French]

> Max 5. Impact order. Empty if no findings.

## Script Diagnostic (when script-rules loaded)

```markdown
## arch-ink — Script Diagnostic

### Context
- **Material**: [script / chapter plan — chapter N, book title]
- **Rules loaded**: [script-rules / script-rules + structure-rules / script-rules + arc-rules]
- **Arc context**: [arc outline provided — or "not provided"]
- **Adjacent chapters**: [previous/next scripts provided — or "not provided"]

### First Impression
[2-3 sentences. Gut read on whether this script is ready to write. Not a summary — the instinct.]

### Findings

| 2 | MAJ | scene-function | Sc. 3 | [≤15 words, in French] | [≤15 words, in French] |

> Direction column: MANDATORY. No finding without a concrete suggestion.

### Scene Grid

| Scene | Function | Change | Tension | Turning point | POV | Subtext | Emotional delta | Verdict |
|-------|----------|--------|---------|---------------|-----|---------|-----------------|---------|
| Sc. 1 | [load-bearing / supporting / dead-weight] | [what changes] | [charged / present / inert] | [pivots / drifts / flat] | [optimal / functional / default] | [layered / thin / absent] | [entry → exit] | [one sentence, in French] |

### Global verdict
[1-2 sentences. Is this script ready to write?]

### Priority fixes
1. BLK #[N] — [highest-impact action, in French]

```

## Alternative: Assessment

On specific author question ("does my act 2 work?", "is my midpoint strong enough?").

```markdown
## arch-ink — Assessment

### Verdict
[Direct answer. 2-3 sentences. Yes / no / partially + WHY. In French.]

### Context
- **Material**: [synopsis / outline / arc sheet]
- **Rules loaded**: [structure-rules / arc-rules]

### Grid

| Axis | State | Note | Suggestion |
|------|-------|------|------------|
| [relevant axis] | [state] | [one sentence, in French] | [one sentence, in French] |

### Key issues
[If problems found. Beat cited, with direction. In French.]

### Strengths
[What works. Mechanism named. In French.]

### Suggestions
[2-5 concrete next steps, priority order. In French.]
```

---

## Alternative: Inline

On explicit request ("annotate my outline").

```markdown
## arch-ink — Inline

[For each issue, in document order:]

**[Beat / section]** — [summary ≤5 words]
SEV axis — [issue, ≤15 words, in French]
→ [proposed fix, in French]

[For notable strengths:]

**[Beat / section]**
✓ [structural mechanism that works — one sentence, in French]

---

[Global verdict: 1-2 sentences, in French.]
```

---

## Rules

### Suggestion law
Every structural finding gets a concrete direction. No naked criticism.

- Finding → Direction column
- Grid → Suggestion column (even for positive states: "maintain" or "push further")
- Verdict → recommended action

### Citation
1. Every finding identifies the relevant beat (act, chapter, sequence).
2. Name the missing mechanism — not "doesn't work", WHY.
3. One direction per finding.

### Severity adjustment
Default from the registry. Adjust per context:
- Weak midpoint in an experimental narrative → SUG, not MAJ.
- Absent central conflict in a commercial thriller → BLK.
- Context governs. The default is a starting point.
